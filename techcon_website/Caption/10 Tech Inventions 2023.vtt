1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:04,259
The future is here in this video, and it's
got robots!

2
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:08,180
The coolest new robotic assistants and other
insane inventions!

3
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:12,950
Glasses that work like Tony Stark's, the cutting-edge
VR tech, and the cutest parking-lot robot

4
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:14,540
you'll ever see.

5
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:18,619
Let's see what these machines can do before
they take over the world!

6
00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:24,510
TCL RayNeo X2
If you've ever wanted to feel like Tony Stark

7
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:27,150
but without having to save the world, look
no further.

8
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:33,610
The TCL RayNeo X2 glasses are "augmented reality,"
meaning you can finally meet your AI girlfriend

9
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:34,650
IRL.

10
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:39,310
I'm sick of regular reality, so I'm happy
to have an augmented one.

11
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:44,039
These glasses have automatic language translation,
navigation, and picture-taking features.

12
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:47,140
I hope they have Pokemon Go, too.

13
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:52,219
With these glasses, you see things other people
can't - it's like schizophrenia, but only

14
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:53,530
the good parts.

15
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:56,980
You can take pictures with them, which totally
doesn't sound creepy.

16
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:01,600
And best of all, while you wear them, you'll
look like Rachel Maddow.

17
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,760
YeeLight Cube
Day in and day out, all I can think about

18
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,610
is how sick I am of regular old lamps.

19
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:11,729
"Why aren't these lamps cube-shaped?"

20
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:12,729
I say.

21
00:01:12,729 --> 00:01:16,840
YeeLight has answered my prayers and delivered
us a cube-shaped smart lamp.

22
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,190
Now, these are not your grandma's lamps.

23
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:23,940
These bad boys can stack, change color, and
sync with music - your grandma would pass

24
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:24,940
out.

25
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:29,900
You can stack these up like a Jenga tower,
build a wall, and make a room to cry in…

26
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:32,909
so many possibilities.

27
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:38,810
HTC Vive XR Elite
Have you ever wanted to fly, go to space,

28
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:40,189
or talk to women?

29
00:01:40,189 --> 00:01:44,329
Those are all unrealistic goals - except in
virtual reality.

30
00:01:44,329 --> 00:01:50,360
The HTC Vive XR Elite is a game changer; it's
next-gen VR technology that does everything

31
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,360
better.

32
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,540
And you don't have to make a stupid Meta account.

33
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:55,360
Worth every penny.

34
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,509
Usually, when I use a VR headset, I break
my nose walking into a wall or can't figure

35
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:05,719
out how to get back to regular reality and
get trapped forever in the vortex of cyberspace.

36
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:11,200
With advanced motion tracking and room-scale
technology, I'm probably safe this time.

37
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,810
So to recap: reality is the one that sucks,
and virtual reality is where I can meet my

38
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:17,700
AI girlfriend's parents.

39
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,400
They're making lasagna!

40
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,260
JBL Bar 1300X
I don't know about you, but when I'm watching

41
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:29,540
movies, I want the volume up so high that
anything under 50 pounds has to be bolted

42
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:32,340
to the floor to keep it from flying into space.

43
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:36,680
If your eardrums aren't bruised after watching
a movie, did you really watch a movie?

44
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:42,060
I want to hear every word, note, and explosion
as if it were happening next to me.

45
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:49,140
I'm not saying the JBL Bar 1300X can do that,
but I'm also not NOT saying it can do that.

46
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:52,930
It's got a ton of crazy features that use
science or something to make the audio from

47
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:56,260
your TV sound clear, loud, and surround you.

48
00:02:56,260 --> 00:03:01,540
It would be really creepy if you were watching
a scary movie.

49
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:04,790
Parky
Parky is a little robot designed to automatically

50
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:07,540
connect to an electric vehicle and recharge
it.

51
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:10,349
It's also so cute, and I want to put a little
hat on it.

52
00:03:10,349 --> 00:03:14,519
The idea here is that you park an electric
car in a normal parking space, and Parky will

53
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:16,230
come over and charge it for you.

54
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:17,470
He looks so sweet.

55
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:19,940
I'd bet he'd charge your phone, too, if you
asked nicely.

56
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:23,459
I know it's his job and all, but I wonder
if it hurts him to have his life force sucked

57
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:24,879
out and put into a Tesla?

58
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:29,090
Well, I guess I could ask any Tesla employee
to find out.

59
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:33,010
Parky would be like a service animal if we
fed service animals to vampires.

60
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:35,310
Okay, he's a big battery on wheels.

61
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:39,290
I need to calm down.

62
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:43,090
ChargeTree Go
This one is for you Apple lovers out there.

63
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:47,319
Sorry Androids, you can wait in the car with
your favorite music until we're done.

64
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:52,050
Anyway, if you're tired of fighting people
for power outlets to charge three Apple devices

65
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:55,019
at a time, try the ChargeTree Go.

66
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:59,730
It charges your iPhone, your AirPods, and
your Apple watch all at the same time.

67
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:02,200
If only it could recharge my grandma's PaceMaker.

68
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,750
Rest in peace, but that's her fault for having
an Android pacemaker.

69
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:10,450
Anyway, when you're done with it, you can
fold it up and put it away - just like my

70
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:13,330
grandma.

71
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:17,450
LARQ Bottle Filtered
You hate the way tap water tastes.

72
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:21,040
Or, you're in the zombie apocalypse and trying
to survive on your own.

73
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,090
Either way, drinking from the filtered LARQ
Bottle is like drinking from the fountain

74
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:26,430
of Aphrodite.

75
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:28,090
Or so I've been told.

76
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:32,139
Hey, I'm happy as long as it doesn't taste
like it's been in a lead pipe for the past

77
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:33,139
decade.

78
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:36,410
The LARQ bottle literally filters the water
as you drink it from the straw.

79
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:41,230
It removes impurities like chlorine and heavy
metals, giving you water purer than a nun's

80
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:42,230
thoughts.

81
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:47,000
It saves you from using disposable bottles,
and this way, you can reuse your bathwater.

82
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,680
Wait, actually, don't do that.

83
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,550
Unless it's from a gamer girl.

84
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:57,000
Aeo Robot
Speaking of cute robots…

85
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,150
Any chance I can download my AI girlfriend
into this one?

86
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:03,072
Just kidding, I already put her in a smart
refrigerator.

87
00:05:03,072 --> 00:05:08,090
Aeo is a robot designed to do dangerous or
dirty human tasks, freeing up time for us

88
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:11,340
to watch the new Sharknado or talk to our
smart fridge.

89
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:17,199
Aeo is intended to be a security system, a
delivery system, and even a human caretaker.

90
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:19,250
Just don't let him fall in love with another
robot.

91
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,490
I've seen that movie before.

92
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:24,810
He might not have a pulse, but he's still
equipped to care for a room full of grandmas.

93
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:30,039
And let's be real, he can probably drive better
than them, too.

94
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:36,730
Aiper Elite Pro Cordless Robotic Pool Cleaner
Let's keep going with the cute robots!

95
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:39,830
The Aiper Elite Pro is a cordless robotic
pool cleaner.

96
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:43,440
I was wondering when they'd make an underwater
robot vacuum cleaner.

97
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,400
If you have an AI boyfriend, just download
him into this little gadget, and you just

98
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:51,110
DIY'd your own sexy pool boy, just a little
more…

99
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:52,110
robot-y.

100
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:55,880
It's a miniature version of the drones they
use in the military, but instead of making

101
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,039
messes, it cleans them up!

102
00:05:58,039 --> 00:06:02,340
It probably can't clean up your pee, so…
you should stop doing that.

103
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:05,229
And you should stop lying about not doing
that.

104
00:06:05,229 --> 00:06:10,199
Don't make this guy swim around in your pee,
cmon.

105
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:14,780
EcoFlow Blade
Alright, this little guy takes the cake.

106
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:17,760
Sorry, AI girlfriend, I've found someone new.

107
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:22,620
This is like a cordless, robotic vacuum cleaner…
but for outside.

108
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:26,410
This thing sweeps your lawn as it mows, which
is so considerate.

109
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:30,710
You can control it with an app, and it has
GPS monitoring so you can find it if it gets

110
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:33,040
stolen or sneaks out to go to a party.

111
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:38,311
It will probably freak out your pets just
as well as it mows, and whatever you do, don't

112
00:06:38,311 --> 00:06:40,300
let it loose in a large field.

113
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:44,520
It could grow too powerful, too smart, too
evil, and listen, you don't want to start

114
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:48,540
the robot uprising, do you?

115
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,260
Thanks for watching this video.

116
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:54,340
If you had as much fun watching it as we did
making it, don't forget to like and subscribe

117
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:59,030

say, "All hail our robot overlords."

118
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:05,419
Remember: with great technology comes great
responsibility - not starting the robot apocalypse."
